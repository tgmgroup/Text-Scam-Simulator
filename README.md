A simulation of scams on phones for teaching students internet safety.

This is a simple in-browser tool that can help students learn about scams they may encounter on their phones. It's coded in English and Japanese in 2026 and includes some common scams. It's all in one HTML file because I was a bit rushed for time, as it's included in the [*Impress - Winter, 2026*](https://s.isesaki.in/impress-winter-2026) digital magazine release.
